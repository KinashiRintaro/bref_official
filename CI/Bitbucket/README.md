## Project configuration

* In the root directory of your project create the file `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`:
```
pipelines:
  branches:
    master: # Whenever there is a push on the master branch
      - step: # Step 1: Using a docker php image to install composer and download your project dependencies
          name: Composer install
          image: php:7.3
          caches:
            - composer
          script: #In this step you can add any additional required commands such as caching, etc.
            - apt-get update && apt-get install -y unzip
            - curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
            - composer install --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
          artifacts: # artifacts generated during composer install should be moved to the next step
            - vendor/**
            - bootstrap/cache/*.php
      - step:
          # Step 2: Using the docker node image
          #  - install serverless
          #  - inject credentials using previously configured variables
          #  - deploy
          name: Deploy Example
          deployment: staging # WARNING: here you define which deploy variables will be injected into the container according to the previously configured environment.
          image: node:11.13.0-alpine
          trigger: manual
          caches:
            - node
          script: #In this step you can add any additional required commands such as caching, etc.
            - npm install -g serverless
            - serverless config credentials --stage dev --provider aws --key ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} --secret ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
            - serverless deploy --stage dev
```

## Deploy

* When you push your master branch automatically the pipeline will start
* The first step will start automatically.
![Composer Install](images/composer-install.png)
* To start the second step you need to click the deploy button
![Manual Deploy](images/manual-deploy.png)
![Finish](images/finish.png)

# Comments

* To make the second step automatic, just remove the `trigger: manual` command from the`bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file
* In the example we use a docker _php:7.3_ and _node:11.13.0-alpine_ image, use the image that suits you best.
